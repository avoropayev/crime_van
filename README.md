# crime_van
machine learning with scikit, pandas, and matplotlib

1) The file 'crime.csv' is the complete dataset to be used.
2) The file 'crimetrain.csv' is the same dataset as the complete one, but contains only first 10,000 coppies of the original dataset.
I used it to shorten the time during testing runs.
3) The folder 'snapshots' contains the pictures of the information of the datast and outputs of the code.
4) The file 'Project_Alexey_Voropayev' is my final project file.
